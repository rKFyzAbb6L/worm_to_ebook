# worm-to-ebook

download [John C. "Wildbow" McCrae's worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) and generate an epub



```
python make_worm_epub.py
```


still hard-coded to Worm, but Wildbow's other web serials appear to be formatted similarly, so should be able to get those added as options without too much more work.
